# Credit

All credit goes to the University of Wisconsin for the format of this homework assignment and the survey questions below.

# Setup and Review

This repo contains code for the password validator. The below questions should be answered regarding your submission!

## Did you find the JavaScript Learning Tutor useful? If so, what about the tool made it useful? If not, why not?
> I googled a lot of javascript to do the assignment, since I had never coded with it before. To make sure there were no errors in the syntax I ended up using JSbin(https://jsbin.com/?js). 


## Do you have any suggestions on how the JavaScript Learning Tutor might be improved?
> I wish the instructions were a little clearer about how to get things up and running on GitBash and Node.js. 


## Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!).
> I had a problem compiling the passwordvalidation file due to my npm path not being set correctly, and Kaitlyn helped with that. 


## Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment?
> Around 2, if we count how long I spent fiddling with Node.js before using GitKraken. 


## On a scale of 1 (too easy) to 10 (too challenging), how difficult was this assignment?
> The actual coding part was about a 2-3, but setting everything up and knowing when to use what was like a 9. I still don't know how Node.js works.  


## Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better?
> Nothing too hard, besides what is already mentioned.
